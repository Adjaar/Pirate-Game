Pirate Panic!

This game I am considering my debut project into game development. 
It is not copying any other game, or following any particular tutorial.
I bought a larger pack of assets, and was inspired by the pirate pack,
and hence this game was born.

Overview
The idea of the game is to blast your friends into oblivion while
sailing the seven seas. The core mechanics involve wind and crew management

Wind
Every 30 seconds the wind changes directions. Speed increases with the wind,
and decreases against the wind. Hopefully later versions will include ramming,
which would increase the value of utilizing wind.

Crew Management
Ensuring your ship has enough crew members is a major way to ensure that you 
have success in your pirate battles. You can gain crewmembers adrift at sea
or dropped by an enemy player. You can lose crew members when taking enemy fire (not in V1).
